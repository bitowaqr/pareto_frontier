### Evaluation of the Pareto Frontier approach for model calibration

This repository contains a simulation study to assess the performance of the Pareto Frontier approach for model calibration.

* The `./R/` folder contains model functions and the code to run 10,000+ simulations with and without uncertain calibration targets (set up for parallel cloud computing).

* The main analysis of the simulation study is provided in the `index.Rmd`

* See [https://bitowaqr.github.io/pareto_frontier/index.html](https://bitowaqr.github.io/pareto_frontier/index.html) for the html version with results.

* The `abstract.md` was submitted to the 43rd Annual North American SMDM Meeting.

* The original study by [Enns et al. 2015](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0272989X14528382) can be found online.
